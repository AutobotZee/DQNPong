# DQNPong
An implementation of Reinforcement Learning algorithm on ATARI Game Pong.  Deep Q network implementation done with vanilla model, Double DQN and Dueling Double DQN.

Code execution instructions for ploting the data from previous data.
1. Go to FOR_report folder to plot results obtained from previous training of models.
2. Install gym and other dependencies releated to the code addressed in jupyter notebook DQN_JupyterNotebook.ipynb in FOR_report folder.
3. Run the first cell and make sure all the libraries are imported.
4. Go to Last part mentioned as "Plotting from the Previious models" and run the code block.

Code execution for training the new models.
1. Go to FOR_report folder to plot results obtained from previous training of models.
2. Install gym and other dependencies releated to the code addressed in jupyter notebook DQN_JupyterNotebook.ipynb in FOR_report folder.
3. Run succesive code blocks to train the model and rewrite the pickle.
